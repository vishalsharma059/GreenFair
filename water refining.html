          <strong>Sustainable Resource Management:</strong> With growing
          populations and increasing water demand, efficient water refining
          practices are crucial for sustainable water management. By treating
          and reusing water, we can reduce the pressure on freshwater resources
          and ensure long-term water availability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Investing in water refining
          infrastructure can lead to significant economic benefits. Clean water
          is essential for agriculture, industry, and tourism. Proper water
          treatment reduces healthcare costs by preventing waterborne diseases
          and supports economic activities that rely on clean water.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social Equity:</strong> Access to clean water is a fundamental
          right, and water refining plays a crucial role in ensuring that all
          communities have access to safe water. It helps bridge the gap between
          urban and rural areas and promotes social equity and justice.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="methods">
      <h2>Methods of Water Refining</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Filtration:</strong> Filtration is one of the most basic and
          widely used methods of water purification. It involves passing water
          through a filter medium, such as sand, gravel, or activated carbon, to
          remove suspended particles, sediments, and impurities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sedimentation:</strong> Sedimentation is a process where heavy
          particles settle at the bottom of a container or tank due to gravity.
          This method is often used in combination with other treatment
          processes to remove large particles from water.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Distillation:</strong> Distillation involves heating water to
          create steam, which is then condensed back into liquid form, leaving
          impurities behind. This method is effective for removing dissolved
          salts, heavy metals, and other contaminants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reverse Osmosis:</strong> Reverse osmosis (RO) is a highly
          effective method for removing a wide range of contaminants, including
          dissolved salts, bacteria, and viruses. It involves forcing water
          through a semi-permeable membrane that blocks impurities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ultraviolet (UV) Disinfection:</strong> UV disinfection uses
          ultraviolet light to kill or inactivate microorganisms, such as
          bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. It is a chemical-free method that is
          effective for treating waterborne pathogens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chlorination:</strong> Chlorination is the addition of
          chlorine or chlorine compounds to water to disinfect it. This method
          is widely used for municipal water treatment and is effective against
          a broad spectrum of microorganisms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ion Exchange:</strong> Ion exchange involves exchanging ions
          between a solution and an ion exchange resin. It is commonly used to
          soften water by removing calcium and magnesium ions and can also be
          used to remove other contaminants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coagulation and Flocculation:</strong> These processes involve
          adding chemicals to water that cause suspended particles to clump
          together into larger particles, or flocs, which can then be removed
          through sedimentation or filtration.
        </li>
      </ul>
